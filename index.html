                My name is Tom and I am a student at the Monash University Coding Bootcamp, I am taking the Coding Bootcamp so I can develop new skills for a career change in software development. I previously studied Computer Science at the University of Nottingham
                in the UK, I graduated in 2006 and I did not persue a career in software development but instead decided on a career in retail. I decided to change careers because I want a more challenging career that gives me the opportunity to work
                on several different projects to keep me stimulated.

                I came to Australia in 2010 and I became an Australian citizen in 2018. I am originally from England from an area called the Peak District which is located in Derbyshire between Sheffield and Manchester. It is in the Peak District that I developed my
                interests in mountain biking and fell running but what I really developed a passion for was rock climbing. The Peak District boasts two kinds of rock (gritstone and limestone) to climb on allowing for a large variety of styles in a small
                area. I have been climbing since 2004 and I have not stopped.
